# Landing Page – Proyecto 404

This repository contains a responsive landing page developed as part of my personal portfolio project **“Proyecto 404”**, focused on building practical web solutions while I complete my Computer Engineering degree.

The goal of this project is to showcase my ability to design and implement a modern, clean and mobile-friendly landing page that can be adapted for small businesses, personal brands, or product presentations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a **simple, fast and responsive** landing page.
- Practice **semantic HTML**, **modern CSS** and **vanilla JavaScript**.
- Deploy the project using **GitHub Pages**.
- Use this project as a **template** for future client work (freelance).

📱 Main Features
Hero section with a short introduction and call to action.

Services section describing what I can build (landing pages, automation, data tasks).

Contact form UI (front-end only) ready to be connected to a backend or service.

Responsive design for desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

Smooth hover effects and small visual details to improve user experience.

🚀 How to Run Locally
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Wilberth150/landing-page-404.git
cd landing-page-404
Open index.html in your browser:

Option A: double-click index.html, or

Option B (recommended): use a local server with an extension like Live Server in VS Code.

No additional dependencies are required.

📌 Possible Improvements (Roadmap)
Connect the contact form to a real backend or a service like Formspree / EmailJS.

Add more sections (testimonials, FAQ, pricing).

Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, contrast checks, keyboard navigation).

Add light/dark mode toggle.

Convert the layout into a reusable template for freelance clients.
